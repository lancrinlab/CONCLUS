Description: CONCLUS is a tool for robust clustering, positive marker features selection 
    and collecting info about marker genes using web scraping from MGI, UniProt and NCBI 
    websites. The tool was developed to distinguish not only cell types from different tissues 
    but also characterize heterogeneity within a tissue or characterize stages of a differentiation process.
